# A sort-of-Awesome List

A *collected* list of nearly Awesome projects, libraries and resources. Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists of sindresorhus, but collected instead of curated. Basically, resources of use to me.

## LaTeX

- [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en) - A \LaTeX class for producing presentations and slides. A good way to quickly create clean, neat, and perfectly aligned presentations.
- [Beamer Theme Matrix](https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/) - A gallery of theme-color combinations for every type of Beamer presentation you could need.
- [tufte-latex](https://ctan.org/pkg/tufte-latex?lang=en) - LaTeX document classes inspired by the work of info-design deity [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), great for notes and academic ramblings. This forms the basis of my [go-to template for note-making](https://aidanstarr.github.io/m%20code/template.tex)
- [preprint-template](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/preprint-template.tex) - "An information-dense, two-column LaTeX template designed for, e.g., EarthArXiv preprints" by [C. Brenhin Keller](https://github.com/brenhinkeller) modified from [arxiv-style](https://github.com/kourgeorge/arxiv-style)


## Python

- [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) - Assigning and grading of Jupyter notebooks.
