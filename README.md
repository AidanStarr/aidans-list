# A somewhat-Awesome List

A *collected* list of Awesome projects, libraries and resources. Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists of sindresorhus, but collected instead of curated. Basically, resources of use to me. In progress.

## LaTeX

- [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en) - A LaTeX class for producing presentations and slides. A good way to quickly create clean, neat, and perfectly aligned presentations.
- [Beamer Theme Matrix](https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/) - A gallery of theme-color combinations for every type of Beamer presentation.
- [Beamer Tips](https://paulgp.github.io/beamer_tips.html) - A slide deck of very useful Beamer tips for effectively.
- [tufte-latex](https://ctan.org/pkg/tufte-latex?lang=en) - LaTeX document classes inspired by the work of info-design deity [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), great for notes and academic ramblings. This forms the basis of my [go-to template for note-making](https://aidanstarr.github.io/m%20code/template.tex).
- [preprint-template](https://github.com/brenhinkeller/preprint-template.tex) - "An information-dense, two-column LaTeX template designed for, e.g., EarthArXiv preprints" by [C. Brenhin Keller](https://github.com/brenhinkeller) modified from [arxiv-style](https://github.com/kourgeorge/arxiv-style).


## Python

- [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) - Assigning and grading of Jupyter notebooks.
- [matplotlib tick magic](https://e2eml.school/matplotlib_ticks.html) - A recipe collection for "Top Tick Tips and Tricks" when formatting axes and ticks in matplotlib figures.
- [latexmaker.py](https://gist.github.com/MengerSponge/629e48336a1e9101cd33047e22caad6a) - A python function to better match matplotlib figures to LaTeX formatting
- [climlab](https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab) - "an open-source Python toolkit for interactive, process-oriented climate modelling."
- [sea-py](http://pyoceans.github.io/sea-py/) - "A collaborative effort to organize and distribute Python tools for the Oceanographic Community."
- [spectrum](https://github.com/cokelaer/spectrum) - "Tools to estimate Power Spectral Densities using methods based on Fourier transform, Parametric methods or eigenvalues analysis. JOSS Paper [here](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00348)

## Textbooks

- [The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/home) - A **free** and **open** online textbook for climate physics and modelling, by [Brian E. J. Rose](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/index.html) at U. Albany. Powered by JupyterBooks and the phython toolkit 'climlab'.
-  [Intro to Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/) - A **free** and **open** online textbook "for anyone new to open reproducible science and the Python programming language". Particularly useful as an introduction to reproducible workflows in Earth Science (Section 1). By [Leah Wasser](https://www.earthdatascience.org/authors/leah-wasser) and [Jenny Palomino](https://www.earthdatascience.org/authors/jenny-palomino) at UC Boulder.
- [Introduction to Climate Science](https://open.oregonstate.education/climatechange/) - **Free** online textbook by Andreas Schmittner at OSU.
- [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics- a survival guide](https://climdyn.usc.edu/files/GFD_basics.pdf) - A monograph by Julien Emile-Geay
- [Data Analysis in the Earth & Environmental Sciences](https://climdyn.usc.edu/publication/data_analysis/) - A **free** textbook also by Julien Emile-Geay, super useful for digestible stats and mathematics for wrangling Earth Science Data.


## Lists

- [The Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks) - An online database of openly available text books in a variety of subject areas (including Earth Sciences)
- [Awesome Open Geoscience](https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience) - An awesome list of repositories that largely makes this list redundant, but hey.
- [Awesome Open Climate Science](https://github.com/pangeo-data/awesome-open-climate-science) - As above but for open Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate science.
